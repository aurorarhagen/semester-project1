# Semester Project 1 - Community Science Museum 

![image](/images/screenshot-homepage-sp1.jpg)

This project is the first semester project I did at Noroff. It's a simple, static website for a museum geared towards children aged 7-15 and families with young children.  

## Description

These are the requirements given in the project brief:  
- The site must have a design that appeals to the target audience.  
- The site must have at least 4-6 pages.  
- Compositional principles, typography, and colour schemes must be considered.  
- Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.  
- The site should use external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.  
- The site should download quickly and not be overly “heavy”. Images should be at most 200kb.  
- The site should consider WCAG principles, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation, and colour usage.  
- The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on various devices.  
- The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your use of meta tags and alt text).
